## DO

- Be easy to learn
- Keep things simple
- Memorable APIs
- Create abstractions that make life easier for the developer
- Use dependencies only when absolutely necessary

## DON'T

- Add unnecessary bloat that a few devs will use (DIY!)
- Create the next fully featured framework for huge websites
- Create unnecessarily complex abstractions, APIs, and tools
- Add bloating, unnecessary, needlessly complex dependencies

# Build

Jolt is not only written in TypeScript, but in multiple files and directories in /src/ to keep development organized. Therefore, it must be combined and compiled.

Compile into `jolt.js` in a build directory:

```console
tsc
```

**OR**

Compile and minify the `jolt.js`Â file you just created into the same build directory:

```console
php jolt build
```
