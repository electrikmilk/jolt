# Jolt

Reactive Javascript framework.

[Get started and how-to on the Wiki](https://github.com/electrikmilk/jolt/wiki)

## Build

Jolt is not only written in TypeScript, but in multiple files and directories in /src/ to keep development organized. Therefore, it must be combined and compiled.

Compile into `jolt.js` in a build directory:

```console
tsc
```

Compile and minify the `jolt.js`Â file you just created into the same build directory:

```console
php jolt build
```
